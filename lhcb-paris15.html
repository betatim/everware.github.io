      <p>
        Questions, comments, graffiti? You can annotate this
        webpage. Think of it as scribbling on the poster to make it

      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/everware">Everware</a> is a
        project that allows you to edit and run someone else's code
        with one click, even if that code has complicated setup
        instructions. The main aim of the project is to encourage
        reuse of software between researchers by making it easy and
        risk free to try out someone else's code.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-6" style="float:none; margin:0 auto">
      <h3>Reusable data analysis</h3>
      <p>
        Everware focuses on the data analysis part of scientific
        computing. Reusing and reproducing that should be as easy as
        pasting the URL of a code repository into a webpage. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Everware provides the infrastructure to make this a
        reality. Once you paste the URL of a git repository everware
        will then launch a
        custom <a href="https://www.docker.com/what-docker">docker
        container</a> in which the code runs and connects you to it in
        your browser. This makes it super easy for you to try out
        someone else's code, modify it and take the parts that
        interest you and reuse them. It also means that reproducing
        and preserving an analysis comes for free.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-6" style="float:none; margin:0 auto">
      <h3>Portable data analysis</h3>
      <p>
        Everware uses docker containers. Containers are lightweight
        virtual machines. They bring all the benefits of portability,
        isolation and control of a virtual machine without the
        resource hungriness and sluggishness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Containers have little overhead, start in a fraction of a
        second and run on Linux, Mac and Windows. You can seemlessly
        transfer your analysis from your laptop, to your institute's
        cluster, to the cloud, or someone else's cluster.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-6" style="float:none; margin:0 auto">
      <h3>Isolated data analysis</h3>
      <p>
        By running your data analysis in a isolated container you have
        full control over the installed software. This means you can
        pick exactly the versions you need for this project. You will
        not be surprised after a holiday that nothing works anymore,
        because someone somewhere changed something.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-6" style="float:none; margin:0 auto">
      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        What is needed for this magic to work? The only requirement is
        that the repository you want to try out contains
        a <code>Dockerfile</code> describing how to setup the
        environment for the analysis. Preferably it should also
        contain an executable <code>README</code> (for example
        a <a href="https://jupyter.org">jupyter notebook</a>)
        describing how to run each step of the analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        The simplest <code>Dockerfile</code> would contain just one
        line: <code>FROM lhcb/analysis:versionX</code>. This covers
        the large fraction of cases where the default set of LHCb
        analysis libraries is all you need. If you need a few extra
        libraries or tools you can add them on top of the basic
        image. Power users can roll their own <code>Dockerfile</code>
        from scratch.

      <h3>User stories</h3>
      <p>
        We are building everware because it fixes
        several painful things we encounter most days as experimental
        physicists. Here is a list of some of them.
      </p>

      <h4>The convenience</h4>
      <p>You can use the environment provided by
        your <code>Dockerfile</code> while developing your analysis in
        the first place. The container will run locally, you can use
        your favourite editor, mount your large input files directly
        into the container, etc. You can use what ever libraries and
        versions of them that you like, not your local admin. When you
        are done with your analysis you get reproducibility for free.
      </p>
      <h4>The holiday</h4>
      <p>Sometimes libraries and software get updated while you are on holiday.
        Nothing spoils your holiday faster than returning to "nothing works
        anymore ... ahhrgg ... why!!! It was working before I left!!"</p>
      <h4>The new guy</h4>
      <p>How many hours have you spent trying to figure out why that new
        student or postdoc can not run your code? In the end it is always some
        weird environment variable or something hidden at the bottom of your
        <code>.bashrc</code> (or worse, theirs).</p>
      <h4>The coding ninja student</h4>
      <p>If you get others to use everware it has the side effect that
        you make it much easier for yourself to take the code from
        that coding-ninja-student who made that amazing Figure 3 in
        your paper and use it yourself. You even have a chance to
        understand what you need to install in order run it in your
        own analysis (<code>Dockerfile</code> syntax is like a shared
        language, unlike the l33t speak of the coding-ninja-student).</p>
      <h4>The helper</h4>
      <p>Often when people need help they will send you some weird
        script, that depends on
        libraries <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code>
        and <code>Z</code>. In some weird combination of versions. You
        look at it and think 'yeah right ... this is gonna take a
        while.', getting things setup to help you will take some
        time. Therefore you will ask for a lot of your favourite
        dirnks in exchange for helping them with your
        problem. However, if you could run it in your browser at a
        click of a button ... one coffee will suffice (and you will
        look at it now, not maybe later).</p>
